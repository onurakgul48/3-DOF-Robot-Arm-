Robot Arm Control System to Automate Medication Storage and Retrieval

This project is designed to automate medication storage and retrieval using a 3 DOF robot arm controlled by an Arduino and Adafruit PWM servo drivers. The system includes 4 shelves in front of the robot arm, with each shelf containing different medicines. Users can select a shelf through the serial monitor and move the robot arm's end effector to the chosen shelf. Once the shelf is selected, the robot arm will pick up the medicine from the shelf and place it in a known position.

Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Assemble the robot arm kit using screws and other necessary parts according to the application you would like to use.
Download and install the required libraries for the project.
Build the robot arm and connect the 4 MG966r servo motors to the Adafruit PWM servo driver.
Upload the code to the Arduino board and connect it to the Adafruit PWM servo driver.
Usage
Once the system is set up, you can use the serial monitor to select a shelf and move the robot arm to that location. Once the robot arm is in position, it will automatically pick up the medicine and place it to counter or another shelf you choose from serial monitor. You can customize the system by modifying the code to add additional features or functionality.
